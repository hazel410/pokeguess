# PokeGuess V5
## Description
This is a 20-question inspired game made by me. The project originated from me playing pokemon themed 20 questions with a friend and wanting to optimize my decision making. Thus, after a few months, pokeguess was born
## How to play
To play, you'll need to clone the repository and install the [requirements](requirements.txt), and then run main.py. Make sure to update the variable `RUNNING_LOCALLY` in [`constants.py`](constants.py)\
I plan on making a web release soon using pygbag, but that will require a significant refractor with how the game works (replacing pandas with numpy)
## Changes from V4->V5
The game was lightly polished in some areas, but most of the changes were internal because the original code was a one file long mess
